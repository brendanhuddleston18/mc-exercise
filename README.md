# mc-exercise

## How could we have prevented this gituation?

*During this exercise, merge conflicts were created by the teams. The primary culprit was the failure of Bob and Carol to git pull origin main before starting a new branch. This conflict was resolved via painstaking comparison of the branches we were attempting to merge and removing redundancies prior to merging with the main. We then all had a laugh and pulled the newlt fixed main branch into our local repo's.

## What did we learn?

*We had a little bit of trouble following the lab insructions to create the "gituation", but eventually got it sorted. What we learned is that communication is key! Having protections for merges is important to head off potential merge conflicts.
